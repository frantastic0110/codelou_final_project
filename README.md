# Magic Cheese Ball

## Description
```
This is a better than a magic 8 ball... it's a magic cheese ball! Ask a question outloud, click the ball and you will find out your cheesy future. Just don't shake the computer (not responcible for damages)

```



## Custom CSS Classes
```
The class(es) I created are: 


1. #ball
--this is the all knowing cheese ball. it begins as a square but then a radius is applied to make it a circle. there are layers of background images applied to give it some shading and depth. 

2.#header - setting up the header

3. #window - this is a box that the #message sits within. it's center to the #ball

4. #message shows the text from the javascript clicks

5. @media (max-width:450px) changes the display for mobile - changes the header, ball size, message size and background images


```



## Custom JavaScript Functions
```
The javascript functions I created are:

1. function tellFortune()
this function is a random number generator that on each click the user makes, it references var choice and shows one of the message back to the user
